        <P>Tell me....Child....When you look through the looking glass what do you see? What madness and lunacy will you encounter?</P>

        <ul>
            
            <li><a href="https://youtu.be/00WCEbKM_SE" target="_blank"> Perhaps you'll encouter a set of twins who recount you the tail of "The Walrus and the Carpenter".</a></li>
            
            <li><a href="https://youtu.be/_gpt2Zb5V5A" target="_blank"> You may even speak to a caterpiller who blows strange colored smoke in the shape of letters.</a></li>
            
            <li><a href="https://youtu.be/msvOUUgv6m8" target="_blank"> Or maybe you will have tea with the Mad Hatter, March Hare, and the Dormouse.</a></li>

            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_of_Hearts_(Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland)" target="_blank">Heaven forbid it but you might even play croquet with the ruthless Queen of Hearts who loves execution as much as her red painted roses.</a></li>
        
        </ul>

        <p> Whatever you see and whomever you meet. My dear you must remeber to wake up from that world whimzy and madness, and return to that reality subdued by logic and reason. For logic and reason are the things that keep one safe from unhingged creativty of lunacy. Wake up my dear for if you don't you will simply............continue to fall. </p>
