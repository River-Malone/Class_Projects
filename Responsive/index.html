            <h3>Meet Da Boyz!</H3>
            <p>Orks are the simple-minded, war-loving brutes of the <a href="https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Warhammer_40k_Wiki">41st millennium.</a> They aren't very bright but they're big, strong, and love nothing more than getting stuck in a fight with "Da Boyz". They are unique among the other factions as they seem to be the only race that is having fun with the constant state of war the universe is in. Furthermore, with the opening of the great rift or "Gorks Grin" as the orks have named it, there has never been a better time to be an ork. This site is a collection of everything there is to know about orks, from their cultural beliefs to prominent figures in their history. So without further ado, let's get krumpin.</p>

            <h3>History of the Orks</h3>
            <p> The Da Boyz are one of the oldest races in the galaxy, along with the Eldar and Necrons. They were created by an ancient immortal race known simply as the Old Ones, and they were not called orks; instead, they were the Krorks, standing roughly 40 ft tall, and with far more intelligence than their modern-day counterparts. The Old Ones created the Krorks and the Eldar to save them from the Necrons, a race that had sought out the Old Ones to see if they would grant them immortality to save them from the harsh conditions of their home planet. The Old Ones refused, and in retaliation, the Necrons declared war, and <a href="https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/War_in_Heaven_(Necron)">"The War in Heaven"</a> began. Unlike their creators, the Krorks would survive the war in heaven; however, as time passed and they lacked any good fights, they would shrink and their intelligence would slip away as their love and desire for combat would destroy any sense of higher society, devolving into the brutal, savage Orks of the modern day.</p>
