        <h3> Da Klans</H3>
        <p>Despite their appearance, Orks are actually a form of fungus, meaning they do not have genders; however, Orks refer to one another as "Boyz". Ork language is a very primitive language and notably has an innate cockney accent. Every Ork passively releases spores that will grow into new boyz. Seeing how they are a fungus, even though they do possess organs, they do not require all of them or need them to be intact to survive. The Orkoid species also has many different subspecies, which makes the Orks more of an ecosystem than a particular alien race. The most prominent subspecies are:</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>"Ya can't 'ave a WAAAGH! wifout a single Boy" - Platork,</h3>
        <hr>
        <h3>WAAAGH</h3>
        <p>Each ork passively puts out a psychic field around themselves that causes whatever they believe to become true, and the more of them there are, the more powerful this field and its effects become. This ability can be seen most prominently with their machine, as they believe they can work; in reality, their trucks have little to no gas and four flat tires. The planes they build do not have engines because they do not believe they're necessary, and their spaceships have windows because the orks think they can breathe in the vacuum of space. This power also affects other people and other races, as shown with Sabastine Yarrick, a human the orks fear so much that the legends they tell about him have caused him to become superhuman. Additionally, the Orks believe that colors hold power, so they paint themselves and their machines certain colors to give them properties. In order of the colors and their effect are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Red makes things go faster.</li>
            <li>Yellow makes things explode better and denotes wealth as it is the color of their teeth, which is their currency.</li>
            <li>Green is the best color cause Orks are naturally green; however, green gives no special trait.</li>
            <li>Blue is the luckiest color, making things painted blue luckier.</li>
            <li>Purple is the sneakiest color because when have you ever seen a purple ork?</li>
            <Li>Black is the toughest color.</Li>
            <li>White is the color of fearlessness.</li>
        </ul>
